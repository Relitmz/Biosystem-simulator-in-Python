# Biosystem-simulator-in-Python
Biosystem simulator developed in Pygame where rabbits reproduce by passing genes similarly to the real world. Future implementation includes wolves as predators

<h3>Current Status</h3>
I am actively working on this project

<h3>Objective is to simulate an enviroment and store genes data to later be analysed in graphs</h3>

Rabbits and wolves need to eat, survive and reproduce
  - They will die from starvation, dehydration or age
  - They will have the urge to both eat/drink and reproduce
  - Genes will be passed to the next generation
  - Genes will stablish consitions such as:
        - Urge to eat
        - Urge to reproduce
        - Vision
        - Gestation period - Born age (Higher gestation period means higher risk for the mother, but more developed child born)
        - Handsome (female will choose if they reproduce or not depending on the male genes)
        - Etc....

<h3>Looking for interested people looking forward working in this project:</h3>
  - Biologist interested in helping me develoup the genes system (after all iÂ´m just an engineer)
  - Other codder willing to help with the UI and back-end of the project
